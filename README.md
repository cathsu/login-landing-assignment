# login-landing-assignment

## Goal and Learning outcomes
The goal of this assignment is to practice working in Android studio, test driven development, and adding files to a github repo.
Additionally this assignment gives us practice sharing videos of our apps working.

CLOs addressed: CLO1B,C,E CLO5b

## What to do
In this assignment we will complete the login and landing page we started last week. This code will then be used as part of the peer review assignment. 
When completed the application should present the user with a login screen. User credentials will be checked against pre-defined credentials. If the credentials match the user will be taken to a landing page where a welcome message will be displayed. If the credentials do not match a message will be displayed that will say if either the username or password was incorrect and the appropriate field will be highlighted on the display.

Add tests and methods to verify usernames
Add tests and methods to verify passwords
Add methods to implement and test a 'factory' pattern to get an intent
Record a video of all these tests working
Submit a link to the recording
Note that it may be necessary to save the video to a google drive and share that link.

Example

Correct username: din_djarin
Correct password: baby_yoda_ftw

User enters din_djarin and beskar_4_ever
App displays: Incorrect password and the password field is highlighted

User enters: din_djarin and baby_yoda_ftw
App loads the welcome page and displays "Welcome din_djarin"

## What to turn in
Turn in a video of your app working, a screenshot of the passed tests, and a screenshot of your github page with the code pushed there.
NOTE: it may be necessary to put your video in a google drive and share that.
